\title{BACDAC: Ploidy Analysis using the Binomial Allelic Content with Digitization Algorithm and Constellation plot}
\description{
Reports tumor ploidy and purity from whole-genome sequencing data including low-pass low-tumor NGS.
    Inputs include read-depth and segmentation data, and ref/alt counts for common single nucleutide polymorphisms (SNPs). Calculates 
    the "Heterozygosity Score" and produces the Constellation plot to visualize allele-specific copy-number as shown in publication xyz.

Description: Reports tumor ploidy and purity from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) 
    data including low-pass low-tumor NGS. Inputs include read-depth and 
    segmentation data, and ref/alt counts for common single nucleutide 
    polymorphisms (SNPs). Calculates the "Heterozygosity Score" and produces 
    the Constellation plot to visualize allele-specific copy-number as shown in 
    publication xyz.
